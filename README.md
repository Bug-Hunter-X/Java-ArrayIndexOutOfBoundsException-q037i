This repository contains a simple Java program that demonstrates an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. The `bug.java` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.java` provides a corrected version.  The error arises from attempting to access an array element using an index that is out of bounds. The solution involves adding checks to ensure the index is within the valid range of the array.
